# Anadya-s-Zoom-Annotations-Type-Final
This is a ML project (Machine Learning). This program was made in Javascript programing language. It is a program which can recognise your position. For, e.g. if you do a thumbs-up, it will give you a yes image, when turning your thumb-down, it will give a no image, while giving an expression of being scared, it will give a scary emoji image and while keeping your hands above your head, it will give a pumpkin image (with reference to Halloween celebrations). This program can be used while attending zoom meetings. When somebody else's speaking, it becomes a problem when you speak in the middle of the conversation. So give some poses while running the program and the program will identify it and give you an image suitable.
